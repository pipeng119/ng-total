    `midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could ` +
    `even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway ` +
    `to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only ` +
    `thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. ` +
    `Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice ` +
    `killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.`;
